When I was in high school, I visited Kunming with my cousin for the first time. Cuz we have her student ID card, I got a chance to visit the best university in Southwest China. My understanding of the word "university" was still limited to "a place where smart people do research." I watching students hurrying on campus paths and seeing strange symbols on classroom blackboards that I couldn't understand, I felt nothing but anticipation for my future life, as if once I got through the college entrance exam (gaokao), my life can offer infinite possibilities.

My mind was really stupid back then. It seemed like the future held endless hope, and even amid the endless shouting of high school teachers, I somehow found joy in it all.

About 100 days before high school graduation, to "boost morale," our grade held an evening party. There was a segment called "My Future Destination" where we wrote our dream universities on the bulletin board. Although my heart was set on Fudan University and Huazhong University of Science and Technology, I wrote down the name of that only 211-ranked university in Southwest China that I had visited - Yunnan University, which I was trying to be realistic. I was even mocked by friends for setting my goals too low.

But how many people actually fulfilled their written pledges? I don't think as much. Among those seven or eight classmates who dreamed of Tsinghua and Peking University, none achieved their wishes. Similarly, I ended up at an ordinary tier-one university in Shandong, and not even in my beloved computer science major.

People are actually pretty adaptable: you've never left your hometown, but after countless cowardly tears, you gradually get used to life in a strange place; you've never had steamed buns for every meal, but eventually you can smoothly tell the cafeteria lady "two buns, please"; you've never lived in a dormitory before, but people from all over the world with different habits end up loving those late-night talks with peers; you're new to university life, but gradually fall in love with those carefree days filled with people to confide in and youthful energy, as if yesterday's hardships are left behind with each passing day.

In such an ivory tower, you found friends for even the most niche interests: classical music clubs, computer science clubs, even radio frenquency enthusiast clubs. In those passionate discussions, we seemed to forget we were at a not-so-prestigious university, and that our inevitable farewell was drawing near.

And, finally, graduation came.

Unlike in movies, we didn't run through dormitory hallways with luggage, shouting and singing about our great but brief years. Instead, everyone was unusually calm, and one roommate even left without saying a word.

That fearless courage, those soft winds we felt while riding shared bikes, those flat sodas from bumpy road trips—all transformed into memories during countless yet numbered nights. Infinite people passing by from infinite distances became proof of all stories that happened in the coordinates of space and time.

Peoples still remembers the discordant practice sounds from the Music College in the morning? Peoples remembers what unsolvable questions we discussed in QQ group-chats? The moment before we leaving, we tried to pack both "information" and "matter" into our backpacks, only to find it futile: "information" has no physical form, and "matter" cannot retrieve outdated information.

I remember reading Maugham's "Of Human Bondage" during those unforgettable years. Philip's pursuit of freedom amid various internal and external constraints—including society's expectations, personal flaws, emotional troubles, and self-doubt—shaped Philip at the end of the novel, just as they shaped all of us in different ways.

Those old dreams and reality interweave into memories. In every corner of the heartless concrete campus, it seems nothing was left between the crisscrossing buildings, but when we looking back through street view apps, memories flood back.

In the history of time, there seems to be no place for us to rest, but when we looking carefully, opportunities appear to be waiting for us. The only thing we can do is, pack these years into our backpacks and continue our journey.
